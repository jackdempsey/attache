WORK IN PROGRESS NEEDS BETTER DOCUMENTATION AND EXAMPLES -- FEEL FREE TO CHECK IT OUT THOUGH


Toupee is a simple flexible visual framework. Pieces can be added or subtracted depending on you what need or want, it is all just part of the "disguise"

Over that time I have saved those patterns and turned them into a lean, customizable framework. That framework is Toupee. It ads a visual layer to your code. It could be used for a prototype or pushed all the way to production. Stylesheets can be removed or added. Everything is loosely joined and highly customizable. Give it a try. Your feedback is also welcome. 


h2. The philosophy 

*The "structure" layer*
It's the barebones style-set to get something going.
It is comprised of reset.css, structure.css, typography.css, forms.css
button.css and modules.css

*The "base design" layer*
The first visual layer. It would include brand,
brand colors, specific styles related to that of your site design

*The "application specific" layer* (optional)
Lets say that two or three applications fall under your brand, you can create application specific styles in this layer.
